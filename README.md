## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

    Craig: Front End/React Functions, Style
    Will: functions, state, manipulating data
    Ike: Back-end - db/model/controller
    Francis: Linting/Back-End Development/Management

### Weaknesses:

    Craig:Back End/Authentication, Presentation
    Will: connecting backend to front/authentication
    Ike: Front-end/css/planning projects/presenting things
    Francis: React/ Front-End Development /Authentication/ Authorization/Design/CSS

### Opportunities:

    First Foray into AGILE SDLC style
    Strengthen Weakpoints and learning other developer coding styles
    Learning to develop in a team-based environment

### Threats:

    Since we are an untested group there is a risk of non-cohesion
    Over scoping our project
    Run risk of ineffective time usage
    Getting stuck and not seeking help
    Unfamiliarity with branch development and handling merge errors
